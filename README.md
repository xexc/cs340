# cs340
This app allows a user access to a database of animals in CS 340 Austin Animal Center to search the database. You search using a filter for animals with Grazioso Salvare, the requester of this project, to create a dashboard. Additionally, this project allows a user to benefit from geolocation mapping, user interaction, and charts to locate and utilize animals for search.
This program was designed to test my skill working with databases and manipulating the data within. Python was chosen as the language to drive for mongodb. Python is easily written, manipulated and works well with mongodb.
